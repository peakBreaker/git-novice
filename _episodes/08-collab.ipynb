    "> The `git remote` family of commands is used to set up and alter the remotes\n",

    "> * `git remote -v` lists all the remotes that are configured (we already used\n",
    "> this in the last episode)\n",
    "> * `git remote add [name] [url]` is used to add a new remote\n",
    "> * `git remote remove [name]` removes a remote. Note that it doesn't affect the\n",
    "> remote repository at all - it just removes the link to it from the local repo.\n",
    "> * `git remote set-url [name] [newurl]` changes the URL that is associated\n",
    "> with the remote. This is useful if it has moved, e.g. to a different GitHub\n",
    "> account, or from GitHub to a different hosting service. Or, if we made a typo when\n",
    "> adding it!\n",
    "> * `git remote rename [oldname] [newname]` changes the local alias by which a remote\n",
    "> is known - its name. For example, one could use this to change `upstream` to `fred`.\n",
